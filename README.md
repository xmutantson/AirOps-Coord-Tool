# ‚úàÔ∏è Aircraft Ops Coordination Tool

A lightweight Flask app for tracking inbound/outbound aircraft ops during emergencies. Runs great on a Raspberry Pi or small server and is fully dockerized.

Now includes a radio feature: it **broadcasts the dashboard over AX.25 UI frames via Direwolf (KISS-TCP)**, and a **Windows client** that listens on KISS-TCP (UZ7HO/Direwolf/etc.), reassembles packets, applies diffs, and shows a live dashboard.

## üõ† Features

- **Ramp Boss Mode**: fast entry of flight details  
- **Dashboard**: real-time operational summary  
- **Radio Uplink (NEW)**:
  - Server transmits dashboard snapshots as **AX.25 UI frames** over **KISS-TCP** (Direwolf).
  - Payloads are **chunked** and **compressed** by default (zlib + Base91; Base64 fallback).
  - **Full table** every 15 min; **diffs** (only when there‚Äôs change) ~ every 30 s.
- **Windows Receive Client (NEW)**:
  - Self-contained EXE (`dist/aot_client.exe`) that connects to KISS-TCP and:
    - Logs frames (packet log),
    - Reassembles the JSON, applies diffs,
    - Renders a dashboard table (toggle the 3 panes on/off).
- **Radio Operator Tools**: Winlink message parser & builder  
- **Security**: CSRF/XSS protections, rate limiting, secret management  
- **Production WSGI**: Waitress  
- **mDNS**: advertises as `RampOps.local`  
- **CSV Import/Export**, **ICAO/IATA lookup**, **Persistent history**

### Quick Start (`docker-compose`)

Create `docker-compose.yml`:

```

Then:

```
docker compose up -d

```

> The container can optionally **start Direwolf** itself (using your DigiRig CM108 PTT). If you already run Direwolf externally, set `DIGIRIG_ENABLE=0` and just keep KISS-TCP reachable at `KISS_HOST:KISS_PORT`.

## üì° About the Radio Uplink

- Frames look like:  
  `AOT <seq>/<total>|<F|D>|<sid>|<Z|B|J>|<chunk>`  
  - `F` = full snapshot; `D` = diff  
  - `sid` = session id (diffs reuse the last full‚Äôs sid)  
  - Encoding: `Z` (zlib+Base91), `B` (zlib+Base64), or `J` (plain JSON)  
- The sender **chunks** the encoded payload to `CHUNK_BYTES` and paces frames.
- The receiver buffers all parts for a `sid`, reassembles, decodes, and:
  - Replaces the current state on `F`,
  - Applies `df.u`/`df.rm` on `D`.

---

## ü™ü Windows Receive Client

For most users, just **download the EXE** from the repo: `dist/aot_client.exe`.

1. Run `aot_client.exe`.  
2. Set **Host** (often `127.0.0.1`) and **KISS Port**:
   - **UZ7HO**: default **8100**
   - **Direwolf**: default **8001**
3. Click **Connect**.  
4. Use the checkboxes to toggle:
   - Packet Log, JSON, Dashboard (defaults: all on).  
   - If you turn everything off, the app auto-re-enables the dashboard.
5. Your settings are saved to `settings.json` **next to the EXE**.

> The client is KISS-TCP only (simple and robust). It does not speak AGWPE.

## üìÇ Data & Persistence

- SQLite DB: `/app/data/aircraft_ops.db` (mounted from `./data`).
- The `flask_secret` named volume persists a stable secret for sessions/CSRF.

---

## üîß Development

Run locally (no Docker):

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
./entrypoint.sh
# open http://localhost:5150

```

### Build the Windows Client (from Linux via Wine)

If you want to reproduce the EXE yourself:

```
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --noconfirm --windowed --onefile aot_client.pyw
# output: dist/aot_client.exe
```

> We now **commit `dist/`** so Windows users can download prebuilt artifacts directly from the repo.

```
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Build the Windows client (from Linux) using Wine + PyInstaller
# ------------------------------------------------------------

# 0) Choose an isolated Wine prefix for Windows-Python tools (recommended)
export WINEARCH=win64
export WINEPREFIX="${HOME}/.wine-py311"
wineboot -u

# 1) Download and install Windows Python in the Wine prefix
#    (Pick a specific 3.11.x you like; 3.11 works well with PyInstaller.)
PY_VER="3.11.6"
PY_EXE="python-${PY_VER}-amd64.exe"

# Download if missing
[ -f "${PY_EXE}" ] || wget "https://www.python.org/ftp/python/${PY_VER}/${PY_EXE}"

# Silent install, add pip and PATH for the Wine user
# Flags reference: https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#installing-without-ui
wine "${PY_EXE}" /quiet InstallAllUsers=0 PrependPath=1 Include_launcher=1 Include_pip=1 Include_tcltk=1

# 2) Path to the Windows Python inside Wine (your original path kept, now guaranteed to exist)
#    If your Wine user is different, adjust the "kameron" part.
WIN_PY_WINPATH='C:\users\kameron\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311\python.exe'

# Sanity check
wine "$WIN_PY_WINPATH" --version || {
  echo "ERROR: Could not run Windows Python via Wine at $WIN_PY_WINPATH"
  echo "If needed, locate it with: find \"$WINEPREFIX/drive_c/users\" -iname python.exe"
  exit 1
}

# 3) Make sure pip works; upgrade toolchain and install PyInstaller
wine "$WIN_PY_WINPATH" -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
wine "$WIN_PY_WINPATH" -m pip install pyinstaller

# (If pip was somehow not present, you can bootstrap it:)
# wine "$WIN_PY_WINPATH" -m ensurepip --upgrade

# 4) From the folder containing aot_client.pyw, build a GUI EXE (no console window)
#    (Your original build line preserved, just with --windowed for GUI)
wine "$WIN_PY_WINPATH" -m PyInstaller --noconfirm --windowed --onefile --name aot_client aot_client.pyw

# 5) Find your EXE in ./dist/
echo "Build complete. EXE is at: $(pwd)/dist/aot_client.exe"

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Optional: use a Wine venv (keeps packages isolated per project)
# (Uncomment to use.)
# wine "$WIN_PY_WINPATH" -m venv venv-win
# wine "venv-win\Scripts\python.exe" -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel pyinstaller
# wine "venv-win\Scripts\python.exe" -m PyInstaller --noconfirm --windowed --onefile --name aot_client aot_client.pyw
# ------------------------------------------------------------
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

- **Client shows ‚ÄúConnected to KISS‚Äù but no packets:**  
  Make sure your TNC/modem is actually decoding and forwarding UI frames to KISS-TCP, and the **port** matches your modem:
  - UZ7HO: 8100, Direwolf: 8001.
- **Diff arrives but does nothing:**  
  The receiver requires at least one prior **Full** for that `sid`. Fulls are sent every 15 min (or on first start).
- **Throughput issues:**  
  Try tweaking `CHUNK_BYTES` (e.g., 180‚Äì220) and pacing (e.g., `PACE_MS=300‚Äì500`).  
  You can also switch encoding to Base64 (`ENCODING=B64`) if your path tolerates slightly larger payloads but you want simpler alphabet/decoding.
